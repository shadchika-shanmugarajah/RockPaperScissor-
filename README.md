# ðŸ¤– Rock, Paper, Scissors AI â€“ Machine Learning Challenge

This project is a solution to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** machine learning challenge where the goal is to build a smart player that can **win at least 60% of the time** against four different pre-defined bots. The program must learn patterns in the opponent's behavior and adapt strategies accordingly.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Create an AI function called `player` in `RPS.py`
- The AI must play against four bots and win **â‰¥60%** of the games in each match
- Each bot uses a different strategy â€” pattern recognition is key

---

## ðŸ§  Strategy Overview

The solution analyzes the opponent's previous moves and predicts their next one using:
- Pattern matching
- Frequency analysis
- Adaptive strategy switching
